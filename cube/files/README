Shaders must be compiled. This can be done with Tser's Shadercompiler, which
uses the XNA Framework. This requires Windows, Visual Studio Express 2008
(C#), and XNA 3.0. (It also works with older XNA releases)

You can get the shader compiler from

http://minilgos.perso.sfr.fr/xenkit/rshadercompiler.zip

You need to create a new project, add the Reference to Microsoft.XNA, and
insert the Program.cs. 

Once you built the .exe, compile with

shadercompiler.exe vs.hlsl vs.vsu /vs
shadercompiler.exe ps.hlsl ps.psu /ps

Have fun!
